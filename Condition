1.	Longer code coverage: when I am using laptop, I was able to see only around 35 lines of codes but with this monitor I can see around 70 lines of codes.
2.	Working with developer tool: while working with browser developer tool I can be more productive with this monitor I can open a page on monitor, and I can inspect element from laptop which makes easier to see how the element are rendered.
3.	Going to previous commit: if I make mistake on previous commit it is now easier to identify with the monitor I can open current version on monitor and last commit on laptop which makes it easier to identify potential cauise because of this I am able to save plenty of time
please make this sentences more professional
